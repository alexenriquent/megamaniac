The basic aim of the game is to outlast all of the enemy aliens. Aliens appear on the screen moving in a set pattern (this pattern depends on what level is currently activated). The player starts with 3 lives and there are 10 enemy aliens alive. The player can shoot a single bullet at a time to try and destroy the aliens. The score in the game should increase by 30 points each time the bullet hits an alien. When all aliens are cleared from the screen, the player is awarded 500 points and every alien respawns (the game is never won). A life is lost when a bomb dropped by aliens hits your spacecraft. When the player has no lives left, a Game Over screen should be shown, and the Player should have the option to restart or quit.
